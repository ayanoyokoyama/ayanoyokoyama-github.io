Hi, Iâ€™m Ayano â€” a content designer focused on clear, accessible product content.  
I transitioned into content design after more than 10 years in localization, bringing a deep understanding of language, clarity, and cultural nuance.

## What I do
- **UX Writing:** onboarding flows, empty/error states, microcopy that reduces friction  
- **Content Systems:** IA, help content structure, reusable content patterns  
- **Voice & Tone:** style guides, consistency across products  
- **AI-assisted Workflows:** research, content variants, QA

## Tools I use
