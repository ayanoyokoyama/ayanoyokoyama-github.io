Snapshot
========
- **Role:** UX Writer / Content Designer  
- **Type:** Concept case study (2025)  
- **Focus:** Onboarding flow, error states, tone & voice, clarity under stress

Problem
-------
New users felt anxious and confused during sign-up. Microcopy didn’t set expectations, form errors weren’t actionable, and tone was inconsistent—leading to drop-offs and support tickets.

Process
-------
1. **Heuristic review** of sign-up and first-run experience  
2. **Content model & IA** for reusable patterns (inputs, errors, confirmations)  
3. **Microcopy system** for empty states, error states, and confirmations  
4. **Tone & voice** guidelines for money-related moments (calm, direct, respectful)  
5. **Variants & testing** (AI-assisted drafts → human edit → quick tests → iterate)

Solutions
---------
- **Expectation-setting microcopy** before sensitive steps (ID, income, SSN).  
- **Error messages** that explain the issue **and** the next action.  
- **Inline help** and progressive disclosure for complex inputs.  
- **Consistent tone** across all states: calm, plain language, no blame.

Outcome (prototype)
-------------------
- Higher task completion in prototype tests  
- Fewer “what do I do next?” moments  
- Clearer mental model of sign-up steps

### Snapshot
- **Role:** UX Writer  
- **Type:** Personal project (2025)  
- **Focus:** Onboarding microcopy, error states, tone & voice

### Problem
People were anxious during signup and frequently hit unclear error states.

### Process
1. Audit + usability notes  
2. Map failure paths and surface inline help  
3. Rewrite microcopy; clarify actions and recovery steps  
4. Pair-review; iterate two rounds
