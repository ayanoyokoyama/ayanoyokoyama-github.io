## Snapshot
- **Role:** Content Designer / UX Writer  
- **Company/Type:** Personal project (2025)  
- **Focus:** Onboarding microcopy, help center IA, voice & tone, AI-assisted workflow  
- **Outcome:** ↓ time-to-activation by 23% (prototype test), + clearer error states

## Problem
Users felt overwhelmed at first launch and weren’t sure how workouts adapt to their goals.

## Process
1. **Research:** heuristic review, 6 user interviews, competitor scan  
2. **IA & content model:** help center topics; reusable patterns  
3. **Microcopy:** onboarding, empty states, error states  
4. **AI assist:** prompts to generate variants; pair-review in Figma  
5. **Usability tests:** 2 rounds, 5 users/round; iterate

## Before → After
- **Before:** jargon, unclear settings, long paragraphs  
- **After:** bite-size steps, progressive disclosure, consistent verbs

## Samples
**Onboarding step title**  
“Tell us your goal” → “Choose your goal (we’ll tailor workouts)”

**Error hint pattern**  
“Something went wrong” → “Can’t load today’s plan. Try again in a few minutes or view yesterday’s plan.”

## Deliverables
- Voice & tone mini-guide (incl. do/don’t)  
- Onboarding flow microcopy  
- Help center IA (12 articles)  
- Content tokens & snippet library

## Outcome & Next
- 23% faster activation in prototype tests  
- Plan: expand glossary, localize to JA/ES
